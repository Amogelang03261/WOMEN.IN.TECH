        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Women in Tech was established in 2021 and launched its inaugural cohort in 2016 in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
           It has since grown, extending its footprint to Cape Town (2018) and Durban (2021), and is now delivering its proven curriculum at public technical vocational education and training (TVET) colleges in South Africa.</p>
